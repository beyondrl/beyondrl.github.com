summary: "Take an AI that learns to play Go and other board games better than any human using only self-play, now make it work for ATARI games. That is exactly what the authors of MuZero have achieved, and in doing so they beat the state-of-the-art on many of the ATARI games. We covered their algorithm in more detail and compare it to AlphaZero."
