summary: "This recent paper by Thomas Kipf, Elise van der Pol and Max Welling highlights different cognitive architectures 'how to see' in the Reinforcement Learning setting. Their proposed C-SWM model is composed of a CNN-based objectextractor, an MLP-based object encoder, a GNN-based relational transition model, and an object-factorized contrastive loss."
