summary: "In Reinforcement Learning, the agent learns to perform some actions in an environment, which is what we call the policy. Instead of having one policy, the agent could instead have a policy over options. Every option contains its own policy and termination function. Suggested by Sutton and others as early as 2000, what is the current state of options?"
